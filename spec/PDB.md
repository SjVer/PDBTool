# Program Database (PDB)

The Program Database format (PDB) is a file format that contains debug information for use by debuggers and other tools.

(See [LLVM's PDB format documentation](https://llvm.org/docs/PDB/index.html) and [Microsoft's GitHub repo](https://github.com/Microsoft/microsoft-pdb).)

## File Layout

PDB files are formatted using the Multi-Stream Format (MSF), where different streams contain different parts of the debugging information, such as types, source files, etc..

(See [MSF.md](MSF.md).)

## The Streams

The streams contained in a PDB files are as follows:

**Old Directory** stream, **at index 0**, contains:
- The previous MSF stream directory

**PDB** stream, **at index 1**, contains:
- Basic file information
- Fields to match EXE to PDB
- Map of named streams

**TPI** stream, **at index 2**, contains:
- CodeView type records 
- Index of TPI Hash Stream

**DBI** stream, **at index 3**, contains:
- Compiland (compilation unit) information
- Indices of module streams
- Indices of public/global streams
- Section contribution information
- Source file information
- References to FPO/PGO data streams

**IPI** stream, **at index 4**, contains:
- CodeView type records
- Index of IPI hash stream

**/src/headerblock** stream, at index specified by PDB stream's named stream map, contains:
- Summary of embedded source file content (e.g. natvis files)

**/names** stream, at index specified by PDB stream's named stream map, contains:
- PDB-wide global string table used for string de-duplication

**Module Info** stream, one for each compiland, at index specified by DBI stream, contains:
- CodeView symbol records for this module
- Line number information

**Public** stream, at index specified by DBI stream, contains:
- Public (exported) symbol records
- Index of Public Hash stream

**Global** stream, at index specified by DBI stream, contains:
- Single combined symbol table
- Index of Global Hash stream

**TPI Hash** stream, at index specified by TPI stream, contains:
- Hash table for looking up TPI records by name

**IPI Hash** stream, at index specified by IPI stream, contains:
- Hash table for looking up IPI records by name

There is another stream, "/LinkInfo", but what it contains is a mistery.

## The PDB Stream

At offset 0:

```cpp
struct PdbStreamHeader {
    ulittle32_t Version;
    ulittle32_t Signature;
    ulittle32_t Age;
    Guid UniqueId;
};
```

- **Signature**: A 32-bit timestamp generated by `time()` from when the PDB file was written. (Generally left unused.)
- **Age**: The number of times the PDB file has been written. Can be used with the GUID to match to an EXE file.
- **UniqueID**: A 128-bit identifier guaranteed to be unique.

`Version` is one of the following enum:

```cpp
enum class PdbStreamVersion : uint32_t {
  VC2 = 19941610,
  VC4 = 19950623,
  VC41 = 19950814,
  VC50 = 19960307,
  VC98 = 19970604,
  VC70Dep = 19990604,
  VC70 = 20000404,
  VC80 = 20030901,
  VC110 = 20091201,
  VC140 = 20140508,
};
```

[According to LLVM](https://llvm.org/docs/PDB/PdbStream.html#stream-header) the version is always just `VC70`, and the rest of these PDB docs might not apply to other versions.
